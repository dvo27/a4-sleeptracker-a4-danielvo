5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
I used Ionic capactior in order to get the sharing feature.


--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
I designed my app for the general user as I wanted to keep the design very minimalistic--I didn't want younger audiences to be overwhelmed by large amounts of graphs or older users to be overwhelmed with numerous features. 
I wanted the app to appeal to most people who know how to navigate a phone.


7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
I designed my app more towards iOS users as that was the primary view I used while developing my code, but both iOS and Android works for my app.


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
A user logs overnight sleep in my app the morning after they complete their sleep for the night. I chose this way of logging overnight sleep as I imagined a user who after waking up, 
turns on their phone just as they would turn off their alarm in the morning, simply go to the app and log their sleep times. 


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
A user logs their sleepiness during the day by pressing the log sleepiness button on the homescreen and then moving the slider around to choose the sleepiness level that fits best towards
how they feel. I chose this way to log sleepiness because the slider feels the most natural for a user to rate their sleepiness during the day across a spectrum/scale instead of say, manually,
entering some number on how they feel.


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
On the bottom, there is another icon to navigate the user to go to the data section of the app. I chose to only have two sections for the app, home and data, again, to keep the design
of the app very minimalistic and to have the app focus on the sole features of logging and viewing data in an effort to not overcomplicate the app.


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
I chose to use a native device resource.


12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
I chose to add sharing capabilities to the app, allowing the user to share their weekly sleep and sleepiness insights to their friends and families. By allowing the user to share their insights,
it could promote a friendly competition between users to get more sleep.


13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
N/A

14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
I used a grid system while designing my app allowing for the app's components to be laid out in a natural presentation and helps the user not get confused of where items are around the app. Additionally,
I implemented a warning where users might put an invalid time range when logging sleep which helps users be notified of a mistake they've made and where they can check to fix it.
